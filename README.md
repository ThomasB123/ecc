# Elliptic Curve Cryptography

Elliptic Curve Cryptography is the modern standard for efficient key exchange

This project will involve implementing and testing an Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem.

At an advanced level the project could compare the efficiency of ECC with RSA crptography.

Explore generation of curves and suitable initial points.

Explore attacks on ECC and compare with the security of RSA at similar key sizes.

Implement and test calculations secure against timing attacks (e.g. Montgomery multiplication)

## Anticipated outcomes

A working elliptic curve crypto system

Empirical testing of the system
