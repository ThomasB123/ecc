# Elliptic Curve Cryptography

## Instructions

run as follows: (each command in separate terminal window/tab)
- `python -m Pyro4.naming`
- `python server.py`
- `python client.py`
- repeat `python client.py` as required to simulate new users

if need to install packages:
- `pip install Pyro4`
- `pip install pycryptodomex`


## Important files

See `Project Plan.pdf` for initial plan of action.

See `LiteratureSurvey.pdf` for initial survey of the literature.

See `client.py` for client program, and `server.py` for server program.

See `paper.pdf` for final paper.

See `ECC.pptx` for my final presentation.


## Background

Elliptic Curve Cryptography is the modern standard for efficient key exchange

This project will involve implementing and testing an Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem.

At an advanced level the project could compare the efficiency of ECC with RSA crptography.

Explore generation of curves and suitable initial points.

Explore attacks on ECC and compare with the security of RSA at similar key sizes.

Implement and test calculations secure against timing attacks (e.g. Montgomery multiplication)


### Anticipated outcomes

A working elliptic curve crypto system

Empirical testing of the system
