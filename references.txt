New Directions in Cryptography (Whitfield Diffie, Martin E. Hellman, 1976) (Cited by 19647)
This paper suggests a new type of cryptographic system, which minimizes the need for secure key distribution channels and supplies the equivalent of a written signature.
Useful for the history of Diffie-Hellman key exchange, since this is the original proposal of the system.

A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public-Key Cryptosystems (R.L. Rivest, A. Shamir, L. Adleman, 1978) (Cited by 22297)
This paper presents an encryption method with the novel property that publicly revealing an encryption key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption key.
Useful for the history of RSA public-key cryptography, since it is the first public proposal of such a system. An equivalent system was developed in secret by Clifford Cocks at GCHQ in 1973.

Use of Elliptic Curves in Cryptography (Victor S. Miller, 1985) (Cited by 5883)
This paper discusses the use of elliptic curves in cryptography. In particular it proposes an analogue of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol which appears to be immune from attacks of the style of Western, Miller, and Adleman.
This paper is useful for the history of ECC, since it is the first time it was proposed, but not so much for any other aspects since it focuses heavily on the mathematics of elliptic curves.

The creators of this paper designed a programmable hardware accelerator to speed up point multiplication for elliptic curves over binary polynomial fields GF(2m).
They also integrated ECC into OpenSSL and tested it with the Apache web server and open-source web browsers.

Comparing Elliptic Curve Cryptography and RSA on 8-bit CPUs (Nils Gura, Arun Patel, Arvinderpal Wander, Hans Eberle, Sheueling Chang Shantz, 2004) (Cited by 1442)
The implementation and analysis in this paper leads to three observations:
1. Public-key cryptography is viable on small devices without hardware acceleration.
2. The relative performance advantage of ECC point multiplication over RSA modular exponentiation increases with the decrease in processor word size and the increase in key size.
3. Elliptic curves over fields using pseudo-Mersenne primes as standardized by NIST and SECG allow for high performance implementations and show no performance disadvantage over optimal extension fields or prime fields selected specifically for a particular processor architecture.
Select parts of this paper are particularly useful for the purposes of my project, such as observation two, comparing ECC to RSA.

Console Hacking 2010: PS3 Epic Fail (Fail 0verflow, Ben Byer, Sven Peter, 2010)
This is a lecture given at the 27th Chaos Communication Congress, about the 2010 Sony Playstation 3 console hacks, which relates to ECC. Sony did not use sufficient randomness in their generation of the private variable used for signature generation, allowing attackers to obtain their private key. This allows anyone to authenticate their code with a Sony digital signature, giving it the appearance of code written by Sony.
This lecture is very useful for details about real-world attacks on ECC, it discusses a very well-known and fairly recent breaking of real-world ECC.
