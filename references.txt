A review of elliptic curve cryptography as it is used in practice today, in order to reveal unique mistakes and vulnerabilities that arise in implementations of ECC. (2013)
Studies four popular protocols that make use of ECC: Bitcoin, secure shell (SSH), transport layer security (TLS), and the Austrian e-ID card.

Daniel J. Bernstein and Tanja Lange. SafeCurves: choosing safe curves for elliptic-curve cryptography. https://safecurves.cr.yp.to, accessed 8 October 2020.
The SafeCurves web site reports security assessments of various specific curves.
The SafeCurves requirements are broken down into: basic parameter requirements (field, equation, base point); ECDLP security requirements (rho, transfer, discriminant, rigidity); and ECC security requirements beyond ECDLP security (ladder, twist, completeness, indistinguishability).
